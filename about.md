This is my latest attempt at maintaining a blog. My previous [blog](http://janimattiellonen.fi) was a custom made Symfony2 app. I kinda grew lazy and wanted an easy way to maintain simple blog entries, so I switched to [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll), a static site generator. I'm also cheap and therefore I host my "blog" on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
