<p>I've been playing disc golf since summer of 2011. Simply put, disc golf is similar to (ball) golf with the minor exception that instead of balls and clubs, you use different type of plastic discs that you try to throw into a basket, instead of a tiny hole in the ground.</p>

<p>I've been increasingly passionate about the beautiful game and everything around it. From playing to watching LIVE competition broadcasts, from collecting discs to dyeing them.</p>

<h2>Collecting plastics</h2>

<p>They say you can play the game with only three discs (one putter, one midrange and one driver), maybe with even less. Bollocks, I say. You need more of them, a lot more..</p>

<p>No, in reality, you could manage with only a couple of discs (you'd actually have a good chance of getting real good with those few discs). It's actually a pretty good strategy to minimize the amount of <strong>different</strong> type of discs in yoru bag. It makes it much easier for you to learn the differences between the discs. Knowing your discs can make a huge difference in the final scores. However, that says nothing about having multiple discs of the same mold and plastics...</p>

<p>But, as an amateur, it's sometimes very fun to be in a dedicted shop and watch and feel the discs, and then buy some and just go crazy on a driving range...</p>

<p>The discs come in different plastics, molds, colors and stamps (basically a logo or a picture of a cat or something, or just a splash of colors, anything really). Some are very boring and cheap (yes, I'm looking at you, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.innovadiscs.com/home/disc-golf-faq/plastic-types-overview/#DX">DX</a>). Then there are those with a very compelling and even "seducing" stamps.</p>

<p>Some people collect discs and actually don't throw some of them at all. They might put them on walls and on shelfs because of some aspect of the discs that make them valuable to teh collector. It might be a discs signed by a pro player, it might be a rare disc that was produced in small amounts, it might have the name Anthony on it (having Anthony labelled discs automatically makes them worth 10 x the money). I've seen discs been sold for more than 200â‚¬ (again, easy if the discs mentions Anthony) in Facebook groups.</p>

<p>I'm not an expert in disc valuation, but here are some things hat may make a disc valuable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>again, Anthony....</li>
  <li>if the disc is labelled with a multiplier value ("4x World Champion", "1X yadda yadda"). The lower the number, the more valuable it might be.</li>
  <li>if the disc is 1st run (certain people think that certain 1st run molds are wayyy better than other versions of the same mold).</li>
  <li>a Pre Flight Number (PFN) disc. A PFN disc lacks the flight rating values (speed, glide, turn and fade) that can often be found on discs in one form or another.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have (or had) about <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://discs.janimattiellonen.fi">160 discs</a>. I have lost, sold and given to charity quite a lot of discs. Why do I have so many (pfft, there are people with several hundreds, if not thousands of discs, so in that perspective, I'm still a noob)? Well, I like (looove) throwing plastics. I also do like to try out new molds and manufacturers' discs. Since a few years back I've taken a deeper interest in getting better at this game, so I've bought multiple discs of the same mold to make practising easier (I don't have to go and get the disc after one throw).</p>

<p>Nowadays I don't buy so many different and new discs. I try to concentrate on certain molds and plastics. I've grown fond of a few discs that I have several copies of.</p> 


<h2>Disc dyeing</h2>


<p>My latest discgolf related hobby is dyeing discs. While you can buy very good looking discs, one thing is mostly true: they are not unique. Thousands of discs with the same stamp are produced and sold.</p> 

<p>You can, however, have unique stamps by making them yourself. You should know though, that the process of making stunning looking custom stamps is behind a long path of trial and error. The outcome depends on the type, quality, wear and color of the selected plastics. Some plastics are hardly dyeable. Other plastics are dyeable but need to be processed for hours or even days, before they look nice. You also need to know how to properly make the color (dye) stick onto the disc. Color theory is another thing. White blank discs are preferred as your starting point. Other colored discs will change the outcome of the color (yellow color on a red disc may yield something else than expected).</p>

<p>And it can be very messy.</p>

<h2>Example discs</h2>

<p>Here below are some of my favorite stamped discs and some of my custom dyed discs.</p>

The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.tallaajat.org">TT logo</a> failed because I used acetone and it loosend the stencil sheet from the disc and some dye "bled" on unwanted parts. I love the pink color though!</span>
